# Sorting_Visualizer
This is sorting visualizer project that acts a tool that graphically represents the process of sorting an array using different sorting algorithms. We always use sorting in day-to-day DSA practice but we never ponder upon the fact that how it looks in graphical or pictorial view. Using GUI(Graphical user interface) in java, I have made a try on how it looks. This project is inspired by Clement Mihailescu sorting visualizer tutorial. He has only made merge sort to make us understand but I have make bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort using java and its amazing libraries. This visualization helps in understanding how various sorting algorithms work by showing the movement and comparison of elements in real-time.
